# odin-recipes 
This is a project to create a website (main index page) that contains links to a few recipes.  The purpose is to practice html.  

Skills to practice would be hand-entering the code for the index.html page, creating headers and lists, as well as creating links.  It's possible I could also insert images, but I'm not quite sure yet.

Other skills is git add and commit cycles with practicing commit messages.  There's also git push origin main and looking at the files in git.
