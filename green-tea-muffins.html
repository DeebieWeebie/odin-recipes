        <h2>Moist and Tender Vegan Green Tea Muffins</h2>

        <p>This recipe makes the most delicious green tea muffins.  Nobody will know they are vegan!  They are ao tender and moist and flavorful.  The hint of almond goes perfectly with the delicate matcha tea flavor.  If desired, you can a frozen fruit such as raspberries or blueberries.</p>

        <p>Making these is super simple!  Start by preheating your oven to 350°F and lining a muffin tin with muffin papers.  You will need two bowls.  One is for the dry ingredients (white flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and matcha tea powder), and one is for the wet ingredients plus sugar (sugar, oil, almond and vanilla extracts, non-dairy milk, and non-dairy yogurt).</p>
            
        <p>You simply put the dry ingredients in one bowl, whisk together the sugar with the wet ingredients in the other bowl, and then combine the two once your oven is preheated!  Gently fold in the frozen berries last if desired, and scoop the batter into the muffin cups.  PRO TIP:  Putting batter into the tin is very tidy if you use an ice cream scoop.  You can even decorate the muffins with slivered almonds.  Viola, it's time to pop them in the oven.  Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </p>
