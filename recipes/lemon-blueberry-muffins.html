        <h2>Moist and Tender Vegan Lemon Blueberry Muffins</h2>

        <p>This recipe makes the most delicious lemon blueberry muffins.  Nobody will know they are vegan!  They have a crispy top yet are tender and moist on the inside.  Lemon pairs exceptionally well with blueberries to bring out the full flavor of the fruit.</p>

        <p>Making these is super simple!  Start by preheating your oven to 400°F and lining a muffin tin with muffin papers.  You will need two bowls.  One is for the dry ingredients (white flour, baking soda, and salt), and one is for the wet ingredients plus sugar (sugar, oil, lemon extract, white vinegar, and non-dairy milk or non-dairy yogurt).</p>
            
        <p>You simply put the dry ingredients in one bowl, whisk together the sugar with the wet ingredients in the other bowl, and then combine the two once your oven is preheated!  Gently fold in the blueberries last and scoop the batter into the muffin cups.  PRO TIP:  Putting batter into the tin is very tidy if you use an ice cream scoop.  Viola, it's time to pop them in the oven.  Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. </p>
